    Description: The N Queens puzzle involves placing N non-attacking queens
                 on an NÃ—N chessboard. This script solves the N Queens problem
                 by finding all possible solutions.
    Usage: nqueens N
           If the program is called with an incorrect number of arguments,
           it will print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit
           with status 1.
           N must be an integer that is 4 or greater:
           If N is not an integer, the script will print N must be a number,
           followed by a new line, and exit with status 1.
           If N is less than 4, it will print N must be at least 4, followed by
           a new line, and exit with status 1.
    The script will output all possible solutions to the problem:
           Each solution will be printed on a separate line.
           The solutions do not need to be in any specific order.
    Only the sys module is permitted for import.
